# Fractal

To compile project you need to link _SFML-2.4.2
To run compiled program download [fractal.zip]( https://github.com/StarikTenger/fractal/blob/master/fractal.zip)

This program creates fractal by replacing the fragment of the broken line by the whole line recursively.
- To add fragment use **LMB**, to delete last use **RMB**
- To change fragment color use **wheel** (green fragments are replaced in common order, orange ones are replaced by reversed line, grey ones are not replaced)
- To see the result and return to editor use **space**. 
- To increase iterations number use **E**, to reduce - **Q**. To set iterations number to 1 use **delete**
